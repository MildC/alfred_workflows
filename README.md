Alfred Workflows
================

All shell scirpt action using zsh as default, but Alfred seems to use bash if zsh not available, so I don't bother modifiy that.

Workflows for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Open Folder in iTerm2
---
Open iTerm and then cd into a directory by using keyword 'cd'.

The default directory will be the current active window.

Touch
---
Creates a file in the active Finder window

Open with Sublime Text 2
---
Open files or a folders in Sublime by using a Keyword 'subl'.
This workflow is modified from [Here](https://github.com/franzheidl/alfred-workflows/tree/master/open-with-sublime-text-2)
The original one cannot open Folder with arguments or through folder actions, the modified workflow uses bash scirpt instead of AppleScript to avoid this problem.
You need to have [Sublime Command Line](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html) to make this work.
